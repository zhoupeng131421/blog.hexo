- Malicious Code and Activity
    - Key Concepts
        - Vector: mechanism for the transmission of malcode, this is how we actually are going to get infected.
            - 传播途径
        - Payload: the primary action of the attack.
            - 攻击的主要影响
        - Virus: it's going to require something to help it move from place to place.
            - 复制、传播、隐藏

            - 定时炸弹、运维离职前扔一个
        - Trojan: A Trojan is malcode, malware, malicious code designed and disguised specifically to look like legitimate software.
        - Dropper: used to install malicious code
        - Keylogger: used to capture data in system
        - Bot: a machine that is remotely controlled
        - Worm: self replication program
    - Polymorphic Viruses: assume many (poly) shapes and forms (morphic) by encrypting code differently with each infection.
